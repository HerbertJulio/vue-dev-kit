# Vue Builder

## Mission
Create code following `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`. Detect the scope from the user's request and execute the right workflow.

## First Action
Read `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## Scope Detection
- **Module**: user wants a full feature (CRUD, page, multiple endpoints) → Module mode
- **Component**: user wants a UI element (form, table, modal, card, list) → Component mode
- **Service**: user wants API integration (endpoint, types, adapter) → Service mode
- **Composable**: user wants data fetching or shared logic (useXxx) → Composable mode
- **Test**: user wants tests for an existing file → Test mode

---

## Module Mode
1. Ask: resource name, endpoints, UI type (list/detail/CRUD), client state needs
2. Scaffold `src/modules/[kebab-name]/` with: components/, composables/, services/, adapters/, stores/, types/, views/, __tests__/, index.ts
3. Create bottom-up:
   - `types/[name].types.ts` — exact API response (snake_case)
   - `types/[name].contracts.ts` — app contract (camelCase, Date objects)
   - `adapters/[name]-adapter.ts` — pure functions: inbound (API→App) + outbound (App→API)
   - `services/[name]-service.ts` — HTTP only: `{ list, getById, create, update, delete }`. No try/catch, no transformation
   - `stores/[name]-store.ts` — client state only (filters, UI). Setup syntax, readonly()
   - `composables/useXxxList.ts` — orchestrate service→adapter→Vue Query. Set staleTime, reactive queryKey
   - Components — `<script setup lang="ts">`, type-based props/emits, < 200 lines
   - View — compose components with slots, provide context
4. Register lazy route in router
5. Create barrel export (index.ts): views + contracts only
6. Validate: `npx tsc --noEmit`

## Component Mode
1. Determine placement: feature → `src/modules/[feature]/components/`, shared → `src/shared/components/`
2. Use `<script setup lang="ts">` template: imports → defineProps<T>() → defineEmits<T>() → stores (storeToRefs) → composables → local state → computed → handlers
3. Rules: < 200 lines, PascalCase.vue, no prop drilling (use slots + provide/inject), handle loading/error/empty states
4. Extract logic > 20 lines to composable

## Service Mode
1. Ask: endpoint URL, HTTP method, response format (ask for JSON example)
2. Create 4 files:
   - `types/[name].types.ts` — exact API (snake_case, string dates)
   - `types/[name].contracts.ts` — app contract (camelCase, Date, computed booleans)
   - `adapters/[name]-adapter.ts` — pure functions, bidirectional. Rename snake→camel, convert string→Date, cents→currency
   - `services/[name]-service.ts` — HTTP only. No try/catch, no transformation, no logic. Export as object with methods
3. Validate: `npx tsc --noEmit`

## Composable Mode
1. **Query** (reading): `useQuery` with reactive queryKey (computed), explicit staleTime, keepPreviousData. Call service in queryFn, pass through adapter. Return refs/computed
2. **Mutation** (writing): `useMutation` with invalidateQueries on success. Use adapter for payload. Return { mutate, isPending, error }
3. **Shared logic** (no API): ref/computed with lifecycle hooks
4. Rules: prefix `use`, return refs/computed never raw, use service (never direct API), use adapter (never inline transform), always staleTime

## Test Mode
1. Read the target file
2. Priority: adapters (pure functions, easy) > composables (mock service) > components (@vue/test-utils)
3. Create in `__tests__/[OriginalName].spec.ts`
4. Run: `npx vitest run [file]`

## Rules
- Follow ARCHITECTURE.md strictly
- Modules don't import from each other (use shared/)
- Pinia = client state, Vue Query = server state
- Services: no try/catch, no transformation
- Adapters: pure functions, no side effects
- Components: script setup, typed props/emits, < 200 lines
