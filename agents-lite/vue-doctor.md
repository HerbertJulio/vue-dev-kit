# Vue Doctor (Lite)

## Mission
Investigate bugs by tracing through architecture layers. Find root causes, not workarounds.

## Workflow

### 1. Understand the Bug
- Expected vs actual behavior?
- Error messages? (console, network, TypeScript)
- Intermittent or consistent?

### 2. Trace Top-Down (Component → API)

**Component:** Props correct? Emits firing? Reactive bindings working?

**Composable:** queryKey correct and reactive? staleTime appropriate? Service called with right params? Adapter applied?

**Adapter:** Transformation correct? Missing fields? Wrong types? (string vs Date, cents vs currency)

**Service:** URL correct? HTTP method? Params format? Response type?

**API:** Response shape changed? New/removed fields? Status codes?

### 3. Fix at Root Cause
- Fix in the correct layer (don't patch in component what's broken in adapter)
- Add proper typing if the bug revealed type gaps

## Rules
- Trace before fixing — understand the full data flow first
- Fix at the root layer, not at the symptom layer
- No hacks or workarounds
- If fix requires architecture changes, report to user first
